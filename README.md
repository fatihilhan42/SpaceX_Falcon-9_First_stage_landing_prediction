## Description 

In this case study, we will forecast if the Falcon 9 first stage will successfully land. SpaceX offers Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website for 62 million dollars; other companies charge up to 165 million dollars apiece; much of the savings is due to SpaceX's ability to reuse the first stage. As a result, if we can predict whether the first stage will land, we can estimate the cost of a launch. This data can be utilized if another firm wishes to compete with SpaceX for a rocket launch. In this lab, you will gather data from an API and ensure that it is in the right format. The sample below is of a successful and launch.

## Methodology: 
- Data collection through API and web page
- Data Wrangling is the process of converting and mapping data.
- SQL-based exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Visualization of exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Create dashboards and interactive visual analytics
- Machine learning predictive analysis
- Report final (PPT and PDF)
